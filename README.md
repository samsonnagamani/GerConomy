# GerConomy Plugin

### Building
Build the source code with Maven:

<code>$mvn install</code>

### Introduction | Usage

**Note: This is a standalone economy plugin and is no longer compatible with Vault**

**MongoDB**  
Database Name: minecraft_server  
Collections:
- teams
- users  

**Note**: The player has to be in a team to use commands. Team-ing is a built-in Bukkit feature.

Accounts will automatically be created when players first join, or use the /createaccount command

The default player and team balance is Â£50

**Note**: This plugin is required to use SokShop \(another plugin by me\)
